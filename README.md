NepMandi: A Local E-Commerce Platform for Daily Essentials

NepMandi is a web-based platform designed to connect local vendors and consumers in a single digital marketplace. Inspired by apps like Blinkit and JioMart, NepMandi acts as a centralized system where products from different sellers and regions can be listed and accessed by users — helping small businesses and simplifying the purchase of daily essentials.

📖 About the Project
NepMandi is a simple yet functional e-commerce prototype that allows:

Local vendors to list products

Users to browse daily essentials

A middleman-like platform to connect both sides

It promotes local shopping, builds community trust, and can be extended into a full-fledged delivery or aggregator service.
